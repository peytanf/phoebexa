|----------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| 1. Dashboard Design & UI | Dashboard is visually appealing, responsive on all devices, easy to navigate, and implemented using CSS or frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind. | Mostly responsive, with minor design/layout issues. Navigation is generally clear. | Design is basic; limited responsiveness or layout feels cluttered. | Poor or no design. Difficult to use. No responsive layout. |
| 2. Chart.js Integration | Includes 4 or more different chart types (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are dynamic and show data clearly with legends, tooltips, and labels. | Includes 3 different charts with minor visual or functional issues. | Only 1-2 charts included, with static or unclear data. | No working charts or incorrect usage of charts. |
| 3. Data Relevance & Insights | Dataset chosen is meaningful, supports a clear message, and the dashboard tells a compelling story using the data. | Data is relevant and generally matches the API requirements. | Data is generic or doesn't show a strong message. Poor API structure. | Data used is irrelevant, confusing, or missing. |
| 4. REST API Functionality | API works flawlessly, uses GET/POST properly, returns correct JSON, and connects data dynamically to backend data. | Most endpoints work with small bugs. API returns usable data. | Some endpoints missing or wrong. Data static. Static data may be used. | API is broken or non-existent. Charts don't connect to backend. |
| 5. API Code Quality | Clean, well-structured backend code using routes, controllers, and module practices. Errors are handled gracefully. | Code works but lacks structure or best practices. Few functions nested. | Functional code, but poorly organized, duplicated, or difficult to read. | Code is messy, has many errors, or hardcoded everywhere. |
| 6. MySQL Integration | Database is properly designed with multiple related tables. Sample data is realistic. | Database structure is mostly good but may need some normalization. | Simple database structure, only one or two basic tables. | Poor or no database design. No real data structure. |
| 7. Database Queries | SQL queries are correct, efficient using JOIN, GROUP BY, filters, etc. to fetch meaningful data. | Queries work but may not be efficient or miss best practices. | Queries too basic or rely on static dummy data. | Queries are incorrect, broken, or not used. |
| 8. Documentation & Readme | Complete README and web services, with each endpoint, installation steps, API endpoints, and how to run the application. | Documentation is present, missing minor parts. | Some instructions present, but not clear or missing components. | No documentation or completely missing. |
| 9. ERD Diagram | A clear and complete Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is provided, showing all tables, primary/foreign keys, and relationships. | ERD is present, with small errors or unclear relations. | Basic diagram is there but lacks but missing relationships or keys. | No ERD submitted or incorrect/confusing. |
| 10. Bonus / Presentation / Creativity | Uses own Capstone data, includes a recorded presentation that is creative, demo, and adds a unique feature. | Simple bonus effort or creativity shown. | A few enhancements but not complete or effective. | No bonus effort, no presentation, or basic submission. |
