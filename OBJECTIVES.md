# OBJECTIVES

## IT322 â€“ ADVANCED SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND ARCHITECTURE 
### Semestral Project

## Objective
This project aims to strengthen students' full-stack development skills by creating a web-based dashboard that visualizes meaningful data using Chart.js for the front-end, powered by a Node.js backend with MySQL as the data source and a properly structured REST API to connect the two. Students must also apply best practices in front-end UI/UX design using modern development tools such as Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, or any framework of their choice.

## Project Description
Group is tasked with designing and developing an interactive dashboard that displays a minimum of four types of data visualizations. The data must be dynamically retrieved from a MySQL database through a RESTful API built with Node.js (Express). The project must be accessible through a responsive and well-designed web interface.

## Dataset Options
Students may choose from the following sample datasets or propose their own:
- COVID-19 global/local statistics
- Student performance (grades, attendance, etc.)
- Product sales and inventory trends
- Environmental and weather data
- Social media or website engagement metrics

## Capstone Data (Preferred Option)
Students are highly encouraged to reuse their existing Capstone project data for this dashboard. This allows them to:
- Visualize real data from their own systems
- Gain deeper insight into their Capstone database structure
- Demonstrate mastery by extending their project with meaningful analytics

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Dashboard Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS + Optional Frameworks)
- Responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Clean and intuitive UI/UX
- Sidebar or navigation bar
- Sections for multiple charts
- Use of modern CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind is encouraged
- Optional use of React.js or Vue.js for advanced students

### 2. Data Visualization (Chart.js)
At least four different types of charts must be used:
- Line Chart (e.g., trends over time)
- Bar Chart (e.g., category comparison)
- Pie or Donut Chart (e.g., percentage breakdowns)
- Radar, Scatter, or Bubble Chart (for deeper or more complex insights)

Each chart must:
- Display real data fetched from the backend
- Be clearly labeled with axis titles, tooltips, and legends
- Be positioned within a dashboard layout

### 3. Backend API (Node.js + Express)
- At least 7 GET endpoints to serve chart data
- Use Express router structure
- Must implement asynchronous MySQL queries (with mysql2, sequelize, or any preferred driver)
- Error handling and JSON responses must follow API standards

### 4. Database Design (MySQL)
- Minimum 2 related tables (e.g., students, grades; or products, sales)
- Proper use of foreign keys and relationships
- Must seed sample data (either manually or by importing from CSV)
- Include ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) in documentation

## Required Deliverables
1. Working Web Application (Deployed or Locally Hosted)
2. Source Code Repository (GitHub or ZIP file)
3. API Documentation (with route list and sample responses)
4. README File with:
   - Overview of the project
   - Dataset used (Capstone or otherwise)
   - Instructions to install and run
   - Dependencies list
5. ERD Diagram (PDF or image)
6. Short Walkthrough Video (Optional but encouraged)
